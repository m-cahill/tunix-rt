Excellent questions. Your recommendations are **exactly right**, and I’m going to **confirm them with minor clarifying intent** so M48 stays crisp, honest, and analytically sharp.

Everything below is **authoritative and locked** unless you later explicitly reopen it.

# ✅ M48 Clarifying Decisions — **LOCKED**

## Q1: Taxonomy Refinement Scope

**Decision:**
✅ **Option 2 — Refinement allowed**

**Interpretation (important):**

* The **6 seed classes are the starting ontology**
* You may:

  * Merge classes that collapse empirically
  * Split classes that hide distinct behaviors
  * Rename for clarity
* You may **not** explode into dozens of micro-classes

**Constraint:**
End state should still feel like a **small, legible failure topology**, not an open-ended clustering exercise.

> Think “field guide,” not “taxonomy paper.”

---

## Q2: Input Trace Selection

**Decision:**
✅ **Option 2 — M46 + M47**

**Primary focus:**

* **M47 error-injected predictions** (where failure matters)

**Baseline comparator:**

* **M46 self-correct predictions** (what “verification without errors” looks like)

**Explicit exclusion:**

* M45 is *out of scope* for M48 classification (no VERIFY/CORRECT structure).

This gives you a **clean behavioral delta** without unnecessary dilution.

---

## Q3: Classification Heuristic Complexity

**Decision:**
✅ **Option 2 — Structural + regex**

This is exactly right.

**Allowed signals include:**

* Presence / absence of VERIFY and CORRECT
* Whether VERIFY references:

  * Numbers
  * Steps
  * Prior reasoning
* Whether CORRECT:

  * Identifies a step
  * Mentions a mismatch
  * Recomputes anything
* Whether verification text is templated vs referential

**Explicitly disallowed:**

* Any learned model
* Embedding similarity
* Semantic scoring beyond string/structure checks

The credibility of M48 depends on **transparent heuristics**.

---

## Q4: Contrastive Analysis Depth

**Decision:**
✅ **Option 2 — Representative sample (5–7)**

**Requirement:**

* Each chosen example must:

  * Represent a *different* failure mode
  * Be traceable to an injected error
  * Be clearly annotatable

**Bonus (optional):**

* One “near miss” case where the model *almost* detects the error

This is about **illustration, not enumeration**.

---

## Q5: Reasoning Graph Format

**Decision:**
✅ **Option 2 — Mermaid**

Correct choice.

**Guidance:**

* One primary Mermaid diagram is sufficient
* Use it to show:

  * Reasoning chain
  * Where VERIFY attaches
  * Where comparison *should* occur but doesn’t

Do **not** over-diagram. One clear schematic beats five fancy ones.

---

## Q6: Success Threshold

**Decision:**
✅ **Option 3 — No minimum**

This reinforces scientific honesty.

If you find:

* 1 dominant failure mode → that’s a result
* 2 modes accounting for 90% → that’s a result
* Messy overlap → that’s a result

M48 succeeds if it **reduces ambiguity**, not if it manufactures diversity.

---

## Q7: Cross-Model Comparison

**Decision:**
✅ **Option 3 — Two-way comparison**

**Compare:**

* M46 self_correct (baseline)
* M47 error_aware (experimental)

**Do NOT include:**

* M47 clean (adds little signal here)

**Goal:**
Show whether error-aware exposure changed:

* *Which* failures occur
* Not just *how often*

This aligns perfectly with the M47 conclusion.

# 🔒 FINAL LOCKED SUMMARY (M48)

| Dimension         | Decision                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| Taxonomy          | Refinement allowed       |
| Input traces      | M46 + M47                |
| Heuristics        | Structural + regex       |
| Contrastive depth | 5–7 representative cases |
| Graph format      | Mermaid                  |
| Success threshold | None (report honestly)   |
| Cross-model       | M46 vs M47 error-aware   |

You are **fully cleared to proceed with M48**.

## One Framing Reminder (Critical)

When writing M48, avoid language like:

* “The model fails to reason”
* “The model doesn’t understand errors”

Prefer:

* “Verification lacks a state-difference operator”
* “Reasoning steps are not compared against prior state”
* “Self-correction operates as a post-hoc ritual”

That keeps the work **mechanistic, not anthropomorphic** — and that’s exactly where its credibility lies.

If you want next (optional, before Cursor runs):

* I can pre-write the **taxonomy.md skeleton**
* Or draft the **analysis.md outline** so Cursor fills it in cleanly

Otherwise:
👉 Hand this confirmation to Cursor and proceed.
