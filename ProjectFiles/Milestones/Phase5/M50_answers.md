Confirmed. Your recommendations are **exactly right**, and they align perfectly with what M50 is supposed to do: **close the loop without inflating the claims**.

Everything below is **authoritative and locked**. You can proceed immediately.

# ✅ M50 Clarifying Decisions — **LOCKED**

## Q1: Executive Summary

**Decision:**
✅ **Option 2 — Produce it**

You are absolutely right. The executive summary is **high-leverage**:

* Judges will read it first (and possibly only it)
* It provides a clean entry point into a dense Phase 5 arc
* It frames the work as a *completed investigation*, not an open experiment

**Guidance:**

* 1–2 pages
* No new claims
* Structured, skimmable
* Written for a technically literate but time-constrained reader

---

## Q2: Metrics Granularity

**Decision:**
✅ **Option 2 — Key metrics cited**

This is the correct balance.

**Rule of thumb:**

* Cite **headline numbers** only:

  * Percentages
  * AUCs
  * Sample sizes
* Do **not** reproduce full tables
* Do **not** hide numbers behind vague language

Example (good):

> “Verification frequency increased from 5% to 97% (M46).
> Error detection remained at 0% for generators (M47).
> A lightweight observer achieved 50% recall with AUC 0.97 on validation (M49).”

That’s credible without being noisy.

## Q3: Architecture Diagram Style

**Decision:**
✅ **Option 3 — Combined flowchart with annotations**

Correct.

**Requirements:**

* One primary flowchart (Mermaid)
* Annotated failure points:

  * Where verification becomes ritual
  * Where state comparison is missing
  * Where the observer succeeds

This diagram is **conceptual**, not implementation-level.
Its job is to *explain*, not to impress.

---

## Q4: Cross-References & Provenance

**Decision:**
✅ **Option 3 — Detailed provenance**

This is an important credibility signal.

**Implementation guidance:**

* `analysis.md` stays readable and narrative-driven
* `provenance.json` explicitly lists:

  * Source directories
  * Key files consulted
  * Commit hashes where relevant

This makes it clear that M50 is **grounded synthesis**, not retrospective storytelling.

---

## Q5: Tone and Audience

**Decision:**
✅ **Option 3 — Both judges and future developers**

This is the right posture.

**Tone calibration:**

* Analytical, not promotional
* Mechanistic, not anthropomorphic
* Honest about limits
* Explicit about implications

If done correctly:

* Judges see rigor and insight
* Future readers see *why* the system was designed this way and *what* would be required to go further

# 🔒 FINAL LOCKED SUMMARY (M50)

| Dimension         | Decision                             |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Executive summary | Yes — required                       |
| Metrics           | Key numbers only                     |
| Diagram style     | Flowchart + annotated failure points |
| Cross-references  | Full provenance in provenance.json   |
| Audience          | Judges + developers                  |

You are **fully cleared to proceed with M50**.

---

## One Last Framing Reminder (Important)

M50 should feel like:

> *“We asked a sequence of precise questions, falsified some intuitive ideas, and arrived at a clearer architectural understanding of reasoning systems.”*

Not:

* a victory lap
* a roadmap pitch
* a speculative manifesto

That restraint is what makes the work land.

### ✅ Next Step

Hand the **M50 Cursor prompt + these confirmations** to Cursor.

When M50 is complete, Phase 5 will be:

* Closed
* Coherent
* Falsifiable
* Memorable

If you want afterward, I can help you:

* Extract a **one-page thesis statement**
* Decide whether **Phase 6 exists at all**
* Or freeze the repo in a “final research state”

But for now:
**Proceed with M50.**
