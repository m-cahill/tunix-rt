I have just one clarification regarding the "Tunix" terminology in Phase 3.2 ("whatever Tunix expects"):
Clarification on "Tunix" Implementation: Since tunix is listed as a placeholder dependency, I assume "Real Tunix/JAX training path" means I should implement a standard SFT training loop using JAX/Flax/Optax directly in train_jax.py (mimicking what Tunix would do), rather than calling an external tunix library. Is this correct?
I will wait for your confirmation before finalizing the plan and starting the work.
