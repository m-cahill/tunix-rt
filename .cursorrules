# IMPORTANT:

# Always read tunix-rt.md before writing any code.

# After adding a major feature or completing a milestone, update tunix-rt.md.

# Document the entire database schema in tunix-rt.md.

# For new migrations, make sure to add them to the same file.


# Ensure that any proposed changes help maintain or improve the modularity of the code. The code should remain well-organized into focused, manageable modules.

# Every suggestion should reinforce the practice of thorough commenting and clear documentation. It is essential that future developers can easily understand and maintain the code.

# All modules and functions should include verbose commenting.

# Ensure that the modules and necessary files are not needlessly spread out in different directories. The main code and files should be in a portable, well-structured directory making it easier to copy and access those files without ancillary files getting in the way.


# Tool Logging Rule
Whenever you invoke a tool (run, fix, apply_patch, search, test, etc.), append a short entry to the appropriate toolcalls .md **BEFORE** running the tool for the milestone describing:
- the tool name
- the purpose of the call
- the files involved
- the timestamp

# Recovery Rule
**Before** performing any action, check appropriate toolcalls .md for the milestone for the most recent entry. 
Restate:
- what you were doing
- what step was next
- whether the previous tool call completed
Wait for confirmation before continuing.

# PowerShell / Terminal Log Discipline
- Log expected terminal output in toolcalls.md BEFORE running commands
- Summarize results AFTER completion
- Add "CHECKPOINT:" markers after major steps (visible in toolcalls.md)
- If session disrupts mid-task, check toolcalls.md for last CHECKPOINT to resume
