"""Tunix integration module.

This module provides integration utilities for Tunix (Google's JAX-native LLM
post-training library). The integration is **mock-first** and does not require
Tunix to be installed.

M12 Scope:
- Dataset export in Tunix-compatible format
- Run manifest generation (YAML configs)
- No runtime Tunix execution
